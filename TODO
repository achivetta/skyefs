  * Refactor the word 'bucket' out of the code, it should be 'partition'
  * Refactor code that does a readdir to use only one copy of the loop
  * Double check we correctly convert all PVFS error codes
  * Fix up error/debug output.  In particular, ensure function or file+line is
  always printed and print server number.
